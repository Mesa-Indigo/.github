## F.A.Q.
### Why did I leave?
Long story short, I had mommy issues and didn't realize it until it hit like a truck. I freaked out and felt I needed to step away from a lot of things I was doing and about a year later I realized that was not the move. I do apologize to everyone for just removing my scripts, I was not thinking properly. Thank god for [DaveFl67](https://github.com/davefl67) for saving most of the older resources. You can still find them there and I do plan to revamp them down the road.
### What am I working on?
Currently, I am building resources for a server I am developing but I still want to share my resources with the community. The plan is to *ambitiously* create an entire server with resources revolving around ox_core and trying to be as framework agnostic as I can be. So far it's proven possible and I'm a stubbon goober.
### Why am I only working on the Ox_Core framework with certain scripts?
I don't currently have the time to create bridges for other frameworks that I am not familiar / developing with. I am working on making the mi_utils resource a bridging script, but right now it is not at the top of my list. If you want to bridge it, feel free to, but please do not spam "when ESX", "When QB", or other ones. If you want it that bad, you should learn to do it yourself. It did wonders for me.
